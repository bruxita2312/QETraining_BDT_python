RESEARCH:
* When and why BDD was defined
In 2004, Dan North started to develop the concept based in favor of behavior.
In 2006 in collaboration with Chris Matt propose the given-when-then as a solution to some problems generated by TDD.
It was designed as a solution for problems on TDD teaching
  
* The most aspects of BDD
 - Applies the 5 why's principle to each proposed user story
 - Helps to define what to test and what not to test
 - Transform specification as a ubiquitous language
 - Does not required an specific programming language
 
* Why is useful and when could be applied
Because helps to all development team (PO, developers and QAs) to talk the same language when they talk about some   
It should be applied always to avoid confussions about how it should work the application.

* Which type of teams could implement BDD
PO, development team and quality team
 
* STRUCTRURE OF A FEATURE
	FEATURE: ATM
	AS: Client
	I WANT: to extract amounts multiples of 50
	
* Structure of a user story:
	AS: Client
	I CAN: retire money from an ATM up to 250$

* STRUCTRURE OF A SCENARIO
	SCENARIO: 
		GIVE I opened an account in a bank
		AND I made some deposits
		
		WHEN I don't have any cash
		AND I need to buy something
		
		THEN I will go to the ATM for some money
